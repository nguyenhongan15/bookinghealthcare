# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights in the booking healthcare application to track and monitor web performance metrics.

## Changes Made

### Created/Modified Files:
1. **package.json** - Added `@vercel/speed-insights` (v1.3.1) to dependencies
2. **package-lock.json** - Updated with new dependency and its transitive dependencies
3. **src/App.jsx** - Integrated SpeedInsights component into the main React application

### Specific Implementation Details:

#### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` package using npm
- Version: ^1.3.1 (latest stable)

#### 2. App Integration
- Added import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/react'`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component as the first child of the app root div (inside the Router component)
- Placement ensures it wraps the entire application for optimal performance tracking

## Framework & Stack
- **Framework**: React (using Vite build tool)
- **Router**: React Router DOM
- **Build System**: Vite
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Implementation Pattern
This implementation follows the Vercel Speed Insights guide for React applications (similar to create-react-app pattern). The SpeedInsights component is a client-side wrapper that:
- Injects the tracking script automatically
- Monitors Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID)
- Sends performance data to Vercel's dashboard

## Testing & Verification
✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
✅ Application compiles and bundles correctly
✅ No new linting errors introduced by the changes
✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Next Steps (for user)
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard for this project
2. Deploy the application to Vercel
3. After deployment and user visits, performance data will appear in the Vercel dashboard's Speed Insights tab

## Notes
- The SpeedInsights component is non-invasive and won't affect application functionality
- It only activates when deployed to Vercel
- For development/local testing, the component gracefully handles absence of Vercel infrastructure
- The tracking script will be injected at `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` after deployment
